        About the Trainer&nbsp;<br /></div><div id="fbcontents">
Lynda Lewis is the instructor, trainer and along with her husband Don, the owner of Lyndon Acres.  She is a USEA ICP Certified Instructor Level 1 Training and is also an ARIA certified instructor in both Eventing as well as Dressage, safety is always paramount at Lyndon Acres.  Lynda has been riding since she was a child in Ohio.  There she showed Junior Working Hunters on the ‘A’ Hunter Circuit back when hunters jumped in a polo field NOT an arena!
            <br />
            <br />

Lynda has been instructing and training in Texas for nearly 30 years and specializes in horses and/or riders who are new to Eventing and/or Dressage, though she is equally adept at helping those already familiar with the sports to improve their skills and meet their goals!

Always striving to better herself as a horsewoman and rider, Lynda clinics with nationally and internationally known clinicians, some of which include:  Sally O’Connor, Mary D’Arcy, Bill Woods, Hans Biss, J. Alex Wortmann, Robin Walker and Kathleen Zins to name a few.
            <br />
            <br />

Riders and their horses will find themselves learning and improving their horsemanship and riding skills at their own pace with Lynda who is a sympathetic and patient teacher.  Both students and horses will feel challenged yet not over-faced.  Whether age 7 or 97, Lynda has the compassion and knowledge to adapt to your personal needs as well as the individual needs of any breed of horse.<br /><br />

Lyndon Acres is a quiet 8 acre facility located conveniently off I35W in Burleson since 
1991.  Amenities include a lighted arena that has a 20 x 40 sand dressage ring as well as 
Stadium jumps in it.
            <br />
            <br />

There is a four acre pasture for galloping plus a few inviting cross country jumps including a bank, logs and a trakehner. Though we do not offer boarding at this time, you and your horse will receive sympathetic, custom care whether in a lesson or training program!
